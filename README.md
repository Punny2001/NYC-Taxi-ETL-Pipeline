# Data Engineering Project Using Apache Airflow
This project uses the NYC-Taxi data source in order to perform the ETL process with Apache Airflow. The data source was kept in a folder inside the project folder. Then, passing to the ETL process using Python as a transformation code. To orchestrate, I use the Apache Airflow to perform a daily transaction to run the process.

All of the data engineering term, it was processed in virtual environment called "airflow-env"

To start the project:
1. Run `source airflow-env/Scripts/activate` for Mac OS. Run `airflow-env/Scripts/activate` for Windows. To activate the virtual environment.
2. Install the required module
